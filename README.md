# Salifort Motors Employee Retention Analysis
This project was developed as part of the Grow with Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program, focusing on analyzing employee retention at Salifort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer.

# Project Summary:

Objective: To analyze employee survey data and build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of employee turnover based on factors such as department, number of projects, and average monthly hours.
Methodology: Utilized [regression model/tree-based machine learning model] to create a robust prediction system. The model was trained on a dataset provided as part of the course, encompassing a variety of employee-related metrics.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization, and Jupyter Notebooks for development.

# Key Features:

Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability of the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to identify key patterns and correlations within the data.
Model Development: Implemented a [regression model/tree-based model] to predict employee turnover, optimizing the model for accuracy.
Visualization: Created visualizations to present insights clearly, aiding in understanding the factors influencing employee retention.

# Contributions:

Developed a scalable and interpretable model that can be adapted for real-world applications in employee retention analysis.
Enhanced the dataset through preprocessing, making it suitable for machine learning applications.
Provided a comprehensive analysis that can be used as a reference or starting point for similar projects in employee analytics.

# Outcome:
This project serves as a practical demonstration of data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, contributing to the field of HR analytics. The code and methodology can be adapted and expanded upon for use in similar scenarios across different industries.
